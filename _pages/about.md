I am currently a lecturer and researcher in the Department of Chemistry at the Faculty of Science, Mahasarakham University.

I graduated from the University of Chicago with a BS in Chemistry and pursued my PhD degree at Stanford University, where I was supervised by [Professor Lynette Cegelski](https://www.cegelskilab.com/). My PhD research focused on bacterial biofilms and extracellular matrix. I discovered [a new modified version of cellulose](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aao4096) naturally produced in E. coli biofilms.

After completing my PhD study, I was honored to receive the Schmidt Science Fellowship to pursue my postdoctoral research at Northwestern University, where I worked with [Professor Ludmilla Aristilde](https://aristilde.northwestern.edu/). My postdoctoral research used metabolomics and spectroscopic techniques to elucidate chemical processes, microbial pathways, and their links to environmental processes.

I returned to Thailand in 2021 and started teaching at Mahasarakham University. I enjoy both teaching and research. My current research program focuses on employing chemical and biotechnological approaches to convert waste from agriculture and food systems into high-value environmentally friendly products.
